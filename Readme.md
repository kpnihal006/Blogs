## Assignment 
Develop a simple web application using Vue 3 (preferred with Nuxt 3 but not compulsory) and Node.js (preferred Nest.js) with GraphQL integration. 
The application should have the following functionalities:
- User authentication: The application should allow users to create an account and log in.
- Apart from login and signup other routes and api endpoints should have an authentication guard.
- Blog creation: Users should be able to write simple blog posts consisting of just simple text.
- Real-time notifications: Whenever a new blog is published by any user, all the users on the platform should be notified in real-time (without requiring a page reload). It doesn't need to be a push notification but if the user opens the application they should see all the notifications of the new blogs. But if they are already on the page then they should get the notification without reloading the page. 

Once the application is complete, please upload it to a public GitHub repository and share the link with us.

### NOTE
This project has been set up with Vue3 (Not Nuxt 3) and Nest.js with Graphql. It has a hello world graphql and REST endpoint.# Blogs
